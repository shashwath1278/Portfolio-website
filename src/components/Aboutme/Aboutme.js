        <p>
          Hi, I'm Shashwath, a passionate ISE student with interests in cybersecurity, web development, and ethical hacking. I'm also a FIDE-rated chess player and a tech enthusiast. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm currently honing my skills in Html, CSS, JS, React.js and Kali Linux, aiming to build a career in cybersecurity. I am quite interested in front-end development and love to make new websites and explore about more libraries and frameworks to work on.I like going to hackathons and CTF events throughout Bangalore.I also love cubing, playing guitar and keyboard as a hobby.
          I am currently working on a few projects on front end dev using React.js, these projects are posted on my github account. If you are interested we can connect, innovate and create together!
